  <h1>How to find duplicate objects in an array? Javascript</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Direct comparing the object by making the object JSON</h2>
      <p>
        In this case, if the property of the objects is not the same, the
        sequence of the property of one object is not same as the other or there
        is less property then this approach will not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach basically converts both the object into JSON and compare
        it with each other.

      <h2>By comparing two objects with the key and values</h2>
    </li>
